# navi83.github.io

This repository hosts a simple GitHub Pages personal site for Vy Huynh.

What's included
- `index.html` — landing page with profile, social links, skills, projects, and contact placeholders.
- `assets/styles.css` — styling for the page.
- `assets/avatar.svg` — avatar placeholder (initials VH).

Placeholders to edit
- Social links: replace `href` on the social icons and the email address in `index.html`.
- Projects and skills: update the `#projects` and `#skills` sections in `index.html` with real content and links.

Links
- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/hhoangvy38/ (set in `index.html`)

Deploy
1. Commit and push to the `main` branch.
2. In the repository Settings -> Pages, choose the `main` branch and the `/ (root)` folder, then save.

Customizing
- Edit `assets/styles.css` to change colors, spacing, and layout.
- Replace the `avatar` placeholder with your own photo (replace `assets/avatar.svg` and update the `img` src in `index.html`).

If you'd like, I can add a blog section, more projects, or wire project cards to your GitHub repositories — tell me which next.
